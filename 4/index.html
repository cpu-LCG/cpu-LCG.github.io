   <b> Research</b><br/><br/>
Hao Lab is led by Prof. Haiping Hao, the Yangtse River Scholar and the recipient of the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars. His current group includes over 10 co-PIs, 5 postdoctoral fellows and 100 graduate students. The super-lab is equipped with state-of-the-art mass spectrometer facilities for metabolism-centric druggable target discovery and molecular biology tools for validation of potential therapeutic targets.
<br/><br/>
Focusing on metabolic regulation of endogenous substances, discovery and validation of drug targets, as well as mechanism of action for nature medicines, Dr. Hao has built systematic and universal qualitative and quantitative methods for complex traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) components analysis, while providing theoretical and practical solution for studying DMPK for nature medicine with multi-component and multi-target characteristics. Based on revealing the pattern for metabolism and disposition of natural active components by organism, he proposed theories of “Reverse Pharmacokinetics” and “DMPK-directed discovery of drug target and mechanism", which have contributed to research of endogenous bioactive substances such as bile acids and tryptophan.
