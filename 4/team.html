<br/>
<strong>RESEARCH INTERESTS</strong>
<p>Focusing on metabolic regulation of endogenous substances, discovery and validation of drug targets, as well as mechanism of action for nature medicines, Dr. Hao has built systematic and universal quali-/quantitative methods for complex TCM components analysis, while providing theoretical and practical solution for studying of DMPK for nature medicine with multi-component and multi-target characteristics. Based on revealing the pattern for metabolism and disposition of natural active components by organism, he proposed theories of “Reverse Pharmacokinetics” and “DMPK-directed discovery of drug target and mechanism”, which have contributed to research of endogenous bioactive substances such as bile acids and tryptophan.<p>
<p><strong>ACHIEVEMENTS</strong><p>
<p>Prof. Hao has been in charge of totally 17 significant projects of scientific research, including National Projects of Innovative Drugs, Major/International Cooperative Projects of Natural Science Foundation of China and National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars. As main participant, he has twice won the silver medal of National Scientific and Technological Progress Award (ranked third and fourth, respectively), and gold medal of MOE Scientific and Technological Progress in 2012 (ranked second). Prof. Hao has published ~200 SCI papers, and over 70 of these research papers were published on top journals as first or corresponding author, including Cell Metabolism, Nature Communication, Trends in Pharmacological Science, Analytical Chemistry and Drug Metabolism and Disposition.<p>

<strong>EXPERTISE AND RESEARCH INTERESTS </strong><br/><br/>
      <p>Metabolomics, chemical proteomics, metabolite-protein interactions<br/><br/>
My research focuses on developing and implementing an array of novel analytical tools in the area of metabolomics and chemical proteomics to elucidate the direct binding targets of small molecules including natural medicines and endogenous metabolites, and gain new insights into how these functional molecules regulate protein function and signaling network. The gained knowledge is thus utilized to design and synthesize novel ligands that allow modulating the structures and hence the activities of the target proteins that are intimately associated with diseases such as cancer and immune diseases.
